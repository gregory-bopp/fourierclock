# Fourier Series Animation

**NOTE**: This library uses an older version of matplotlib (3.1.2), and is incompatible with newer versions.

Animate the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of a sequence as described in this [3 Blue 1 Brown video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r6sGWTCMz2k).


## Examples

`lissajous.py`: Applies the DFT to a parametrically defined function E.g. [Lissajous Curve](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lissajous_curve)
